									<a href="https://github.com/JakeWellian/Python_projects/blob/main/BMI_python.ipynb" class="image fit"><img src="images\BMI_project.jpg" height="300px" alt="" /></a>
									<p><strong> &#x2022 DESCRIPTION & ACHIEVEMENTS:</strong> How has Body Mass Index (BMI) been changing over the last few decades? And which countries are most susceptible to these rising trends? I explored these questions using MySQL, Tableau, & Python. Firstly, I used MySQL to clean and prepare the data. Then I used Tableau to create visual and interactive graphs. And finally, I created a full report and built a BMI calculator in Python.
									<br /><br /><strong> &#x2022 TECHNICAL SKILLS: </strong> Python, MySQL, Tableau, Time series, Forecasting, BMI Calculator
